Insights and recommendations: 
    1) The market in Mexico shows the highest NPS. 
        - Investigate the drivers of this high NPS in Mexico by conducting qualitative research (customer interviews, surveys focusing on positive experiences) to understand what the bank is doing exceptionally well in this market.
    2) The market in the US has the highest percentage of detractors, directly contributing to its lower NPS. 
        - Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the customer journey and pain points in the US market to identify areas where customers are dissatisfied (e.g., specific services, processes, communication). 
    3) There are significant percentages of passives across all markets. This represents a significant portion of customers who are neutral and potentially susceptible to competitor offers. 
        - Develop strategies to convert passives into promoters in all markets, including personalized offers through loyalty program upgrades or tailored discounts and enhanced communication through new features or services.
